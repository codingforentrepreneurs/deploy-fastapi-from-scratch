# Deploy FastAPI from Scratch to a production server with this series.

As you go down the rabbit hole of building Python Web Applications you inevitably start to wonder how this is all going to run in a live, production, environment. This series aims to answer this question by deploying a basic Python Web Application from scratch to Linode's powerful and cost-effective service. Once you understand the fundamentals from scratch, you can learn to deploy using more scalable and powerful solutions (like Terraform, Ansible, and others).
